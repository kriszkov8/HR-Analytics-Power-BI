HR Attendance Analytics Dashboard

Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive dashboard to analyze employee attendance data within a company. Using real business data, the dashboard tracks work from home days, office attendance, sick leaves, and holidays. I imported the data from Excel into Power BI and refined it with DAX to ensure accurate and insightful visualizations.

Objective
